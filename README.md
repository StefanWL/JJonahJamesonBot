He wants pictures of spiderman

Image recognition AI built using ML.NET.
This project is in two parts, this is the API.
This API consumes a trained machine learning model to classify images as either spiderman or not spiderman.
The UI is fairly simple only prompting the user for photos of spiderman and displaying a reaction appropriate for what the user's submitted.
